# CSRF Optimal eDNA Detection Period 
R Scripts (Created 26 Oct 2022, M. Morrison)



This repository is intended to store and obtain feedback on scripts used to clean and/or consolidate eDNA data from metabarcoding and qPCR projects for use in CSRF Database. 

## Stack metabarcoding data and find species info
This script (1) transforms raw metabarcoding .csv files so data can be inputted to the database, and (2) obtains taxonomic information for species from the WoRMS database.

## Consolidate qPCR metadata and samples
This script pulls completed .xlsx files in the same directory and cleans metadata so multiple projects can be analysed.
